# Funny-Ball-Game

# After separating the main script code which is currently handling absolutely everything into Main, obstacle, player movement + collision, and so on, I would then start thinking about features to add.
# Features ot add could include 1. Other levels, this could be the introduction level and next would be level 1.
# 2. perhaps there could be like color themes, like the first 10 levels are these simple colors, but the next 25 after could be like autumn themed colors, then other seasons, then it could go into things like nature, industrial. All that would be changing both the background, obstacle and player colors.
# 3. The score system could be improved by giving more score for the completion speed.
# 4. This game surely DOES NOT NEED upgrades, maybe you could get a currency for like a level-skip mechanic? meybe if you fail a lot you could get a pop-up saying do you want to skip? Or perhaps like a revive mechanic if you die you can spend 100 of currency to continue (or watch an ad $$$).
